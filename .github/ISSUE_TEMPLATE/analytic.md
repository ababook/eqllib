## Analytic Description
* *What attacker technique are you looking to detect?*
* *Was there a recent blogpost, Tweet, etc. about the technique?*
* *Is this a high-fidelity detection, or a query with data stacking for hunting?*
* *Do you have any thoughts how to structure your query?*
* *Would you expect this analytic to be noisy? High false positive rates?*
