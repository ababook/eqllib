## Schema Description
* *What data source does this schema describe?*
* *What OS, hardware, device, etc. does this schema represent?*
* *What are the specific fields you would expect in the data, e.g. process_name, file_name, ip_address, etc.?*
* *Are there many different event types in this query?*
* *Here is a Sysmon [example](https://github.com/endgameinc/eqllib/blob/master/eqllib/sources/sysmon.toml).*
* *Do you intend to keep or drop fields that are not mapped?*
